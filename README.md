# About
This repo will be for any visualization I make; may it be for an algorithm, a physics experiment, and idea I have; What ever.

All the visualizations are (and will be) written in [Processing](https://processing.org/), a Java based framework used for graphics.

This repository should be fun (well, I had fun writing this code) and somewhat educational at the same time (like all the projects that can be made with processing).

I will keep this main README up to date with gifs of the included visualizations so you can have a quick idea of what every project is about.
